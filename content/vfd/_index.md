description: VFD tubes usually contain multiple phosphor-coated segments, each positioned in front of an anode. Electrons emitted from the cathode are accelrated towards positively the charged anodes, striking the phosphor and causing it to light up. By combining multiple segments, digits and various other characters can be displayed.
