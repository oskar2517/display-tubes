The LC-516, produced by Polish tube manufacturer Dolam (later known as Unitra Dolam), is pin-compatible with and visually similar to the Soviet [IN-1 Nixie](/nixie/anod-in-1/) tube. However, unlike the IN-1—an early model with a relatively short lifespan—the LC-516 is mercury-doped, significantly enhancing its durability and giving its glow a subtle bluish tint. The LC-516 features a slightly smaller glass envelope and digits compared to the IN-1; a comparison between the two is shown below. Additionally, Dolam manufactured a version without the phenolic base, designated as the LC-513.

As I am not aware of a datasheet specifically for this tube, I have provided a link to the IN-1's datasheet below. Since the tubes are compatible, the relevant specifications should be identical.

**Update from 2025-05-18**

I was able to acquire a slightly different version of the LC-516, featuring a larger glass envelope and digit sizes comparable to the IN-1. This variant appears to lack mercury vapor and has a slightly different digit arrangement. I suspect it may be an earlier revision of the model. Photos are provided below.
