The DGM01 is a modern Nixie tube produced by Sadudu and his company iNixie LAB in China, comparable in size to the Soviet [IN-18](/nixie/gazotron-in-18/). Like the [R|Z568M](/nixie/dalibor-farny-rz568m/) by Dalibor Farný, the DGM01 is assembled by hand in small quantities. Each digit in the tube has a distinctive design, with the numbers one and five standing out in particular. Notably, the DGM01 features a right decimal point which is unusual for tubes of this size and was specifically incorporated for use in replicas of the Divergence Meter from the popular anime series Steins;Gate. Unlike the R|Z568M and tubes made by Millclock, which have a large metal bases, the DGM01 utilizes proper pin-to-glass seals, enhancing its authentic appearance. The glow discharge exhibits the characteristic blue tint seen in tubes containing mercury vapor, which is indicative of long-life Nixie tubes.

Development of the DGM01 began in 2020, with the final product becoming available in 2023. The DGM01 is relatively affordable compared to offerings from Dalibor Farný and Millclock. The manufacturer provides a five-year warranty on each tube sold.
