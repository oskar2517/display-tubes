The B-5441A is a medium-sized Nixie tube manufactured by Burroughs. What sets this tube apart is the fact that it was evacuated from the bottom, a feature usually only found in larger side-viewing Nixie tubes. This design results in a perfectly dome-shaped top. In addition to displaying digits zero through nine, the B-5441A also includes both left and right decimal points. These distinctive features make it highly sought after by collectors, particularly fans of the popular anime Steins;Gate, who consider its shape ideal for recreating the "Divergence Meter" device featured in the series. 

The silvery coating visible on the inside of the glass near the base is normal and not indicative of damage or wear The B-5441 (without A) is identical to the tube shown on this page but is evacuated from the top. Another closely related tube is the B-5440A which only has a single decimal point.
