The GR-211 is a large Nixie tube produced by Rodan-Okaya in Japan. It ranks as the third-largest Nixie tube made by Rodan and succeeded the short-lived GR-11. Later models were rebranded as CD94. Notably, the GR-211 includes a left decimal point, which is uncommon for tubes of its size. In devices using larger Nixie tubes, a separate neon bulb typically represented the comma instead. Interestingly, the datasheet marks the decimal point's pin as "not connected."

Like most Rodan-manufactured Nixie tubes, the GR-211 features an unusually intricate design and the distinctive, warm glow characteristic of their tubes. Its aesthetic appeal is further enhanced by a chromium-plated base and the golden sticker, typical of Japanese tubes.

Originally, the GR-211 came packaged with a compatible socket in its box. Unfortunately, my unit is missing both the box and the included socket.
