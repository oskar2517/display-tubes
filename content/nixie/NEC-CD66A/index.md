The CD66A, produced by NEC in Japan, is a medium-sized Nixie tube capable of displaying all ten digits along with a right decimal point. It features a distinctive anode design made up of multiple horizontal wires, differing from the typical hexagonal or square grids stamped from sheet metal in most Nixie tubes. A variant of the CD66 with a left decimal point was also available. Additionally, the CD66A is pin-compatible with the European ZM1242, which has a more conventional design.
