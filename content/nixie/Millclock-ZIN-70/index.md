The ZIN-70 is a modern Nixie tube and, with its 70mm digits, ranks among the largest ever produced. Handmade in limited quantities by the Ukrainian company Millclock, it is available both as part of their Nixie clock range and as a standalone component. Its construction bears a strong resemblance to another contemporary Nixie tube: the [R|Z568M](/nixie/dalibor-farny-rz568m/), manufactured by Dalibor Farný and his company. A comparison image below shows the ZIN-70 on the left and the R|Z568M on the right.

The ZIN-70 features a substantial aluminum base that conceals the tube's seal, offered in either a brushed aluminum finish or a sleek black version. It comes in two different pinout configurations, one of which (the one shown on this page) is compatible with the SK-137 socket used by both the R|Z568M and the original Z568M. Both types have each pin clearly labelled. The tube's digits are elegantly designed, with the numerals '5' and '7' being especially distinctive. This effect is enhanced by the rather coarse anode grid, which allows for excellent visibility of the digits. The tube is free from any markings on the glass envelope and anode cage and appears to be exceptionally well made with clear attention to detail and no perceivable imperfections.

The ZIN-70 is somewhat more affordable than Dalibor Farný's tubes; however, it's worth noting that Millclock does not appear to offer the same 10-year warranty that Farný provides with his tubes.
