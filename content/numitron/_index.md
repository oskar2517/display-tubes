description: Numitrons utilize multiple incandescant filaments to represent digits and other symbols, similar to other types of segmented displays. The key advantage of Numitrons over Nixie tubes was that they did not require high voltages, allowing them to be driven directly by logic-level signals or cheap low voltage transistors.
