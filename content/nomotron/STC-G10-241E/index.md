The STC G10/241E is an early neon-filled counting tube, classified as a Nomotron, allowing for up to 20,000 counts/second. It operates in a unidirectional, single-pulse mode, advancing the discharge by one position with each pulse and featuring ten stable positions. Unlike conventional decadic counting tubes (Dekatrons), its guiding electrodes are concealed behind a metal shell. Only the stable cathodes are visible through circular openings, each marked with its corresponding value on a transparent mica shield.

The tube features a specialized socket design based on the B12A socket, incorporating an additional central pin that connects to the tube's anode.

This particular unit includes two handwritten markings: one labeled "162" in the center of the mica shield and another, "B129CW," etched into the metal shell. The production of these tubes likely required significant manual craftsmanship.
