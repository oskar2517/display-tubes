The 6ME5 (also known as 6M-E5) is a miniature magic eye tube manufactured by TOYO in Japan. It closely resembles the common [6E5 tube](/magic-eye/ken-rad-6e5/), but in a smaller form factor, featuring the same basic display characteristic of a single shadow that opens or closes according to the applied input voltage. The tube operates at a relatively low target voltage of 180V, while a similar variant, the 6ME10, works at an even lower target voltage of just 100V.

Although it was used in certain radios, such as the Heathkit GR-21, the 6ME5 remains a rare and unusual tube.
