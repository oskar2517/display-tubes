description: Dekatrons are gas-filled counting tubes primarily used in early computers, calculators and devices requiring frequency devision during the 1950s and 1960s. When a Dekatron is in operation, a discharge occupies one of typically ten stable positions. Each counting pulse moves the discharge to the next cathode, often generating a voltage spike that can trigger specific actions.
