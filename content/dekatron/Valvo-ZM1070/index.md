The ZM1070 is a neon-filled, double-pulse decadic counting tube manufactured by Valvo in Germany. It supports bi-directional counting and operates at speeds of up to 5,000 counts per second. Each of its ten stable cathodes is connected to a separate pin, allowing external actions to be triggered when a specific cathode is active. This design also enables the tube to be reset to any of its ten positions by applying a brief negative pulse to the desired electrode.

Compared to many other Dekatron tubes, such as the GC12/4B and GC10B/S from ETL in Great Britain, the ZM1070 features a more compact form factor. This makes it particularly well-suited for use in Nixie clocks, where Dekatrons are often employed as seconds indicators.

The equivalent British tube is the Z504S, which was manufactured by Mullard and other companies.
