The Z565M is a neon-filled decadic display tube produced by RFT in East Germany and sometimes referred to as a "Register Tube". Although it resembles a Dekatron, it lacks any kind of counting capability. Unlike Pixie tubes such as the [ZM1050/Z550M](/other/valvo-z550m/), it also cannot be controlled using logic-level signals. Instead, it operates more like a regular Nixie tube. 

It features ten wire-formed cathodes arranged in a circle around a common anode, with each cathode activated by connecting it to ground. When viewed from the front, the tube shows two empty holes between each cathode. In a full Dekatron tube, these positions would have been occupied by the transfer electrodes. To ensure consistent ignition regardless of ambient light or background radiation, the Z565M includes a small amount of radioactive material to improve the rate of spontaneous ionization of the neon gas.

The Z565M is visually compatible with Dekatron-based counting circuits, making it a suitable display component in such systems. Similar tubes include the GR10A and Z503M.
